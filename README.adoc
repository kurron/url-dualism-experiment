= URL Dualism Experiment
Ron Kurr <rkurr@jvmguy.com>


toc::[]

== Overview
In the book https://pragprog.com/book/mnee2/release-it-second-edition[Release It! Second Edition: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software] the author, Michael Nygard, introduces the concept of URL Dualism.  This project attempts to implement the concept in a variety environments, discussing trade-offs and challenges along the way.

== Context
There a few concepts and assumptions that need to be described before we can begin to analyze possible implementations of the URL Dualism pattern.

=== Services Control Their Own Identifiers
The assumption here is that we are working in a world of cooperating services that maintain their own state -- no shared databases.  If you need information, you go the service to get it.  When a new entity is introduced into the system, the service issues the identifier for it.

=== Explicit Context
In the book, Nygard suggest the traditional identifiers are limiting to use in current architectures because they do not carry enough context to allow a client to locate the authoritative system.  Using a URL provides more context, giving the caller the ability to "tug" on the URL and get more information.

* an https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS] account
* an SSH client
* familiarity with https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[EC2]

IMPORTANT: we will be using the same EC2 instances for the labs so always have your SSH key available when we meet.

TIP: Learners running Windows have had good success with http://gitforwindows.org/[Git BASH].

== Lab 01: Setting Up The Testing Environment
In order to give Ansible inventory to work on, we need to setup several small EC2 instances.  In your Amazon account, create the following:

. a new SSH key pair
. an Ubuntu `t2.nano` instance named Ansible Control
. an Ubuntu `t2.nano` instance named Alpha
. an Ubuntu `t2.nano` instance named Bravo
. an Amazon Linux `t2.nano` instance named Charlie
. an Amazon Linux `t2.nano` instance named Delta

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the security group on the instances allows inbound SSH access (port 22).

TIP: Store your SSH keys on a USB stick so you can use different computers to connect to your control instance.

CAUTION: Remember to not use your root account when setting things up.  An Administrator IAM account is highly recommended.


Ansible uses SSH so we need to verify SSH is working as required.

. copy the private half of your SSH key to the control box
. from the control box, ensure you can SSH into Alpha
. from the control box, ensure you can SSH into Bravo
. from the control box, ensure you can SSH into Charlie
. from the control box, ensure you can SSH into Delta
. stop all of your instances

TIP: The `scp` command can be used to upload the key file.

IMPORTANT: SSH is very picky about file permissions so remember to set the proper permissions on the key prior to use.

== Lab 02: Installing Ansible
. Install the Ansible PPA on the Ansible control box.
. Have Ansible print its version to verify the installation

TIP: The video has the steps as does the Ansible documentation. The documentation is easier to follow.

== Lab 03: Configuring Ansible
. use the `ansible` command to apply the `ping` module to the `alpha` box.  Do *not* use a `hosts` or `ansible.cfg` file, specifying the information using command-line switches instead.
. create an `ansible.cfg` file, specifying the location of your private SSH key
. apply the `ping` module again, using the `ansible.cfg` file this time

TIP: When specifying inventory on the command line, makes sure to have a trailing comma `,`

TIP: Format of the configuration file http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html[can be found here].

TIP: Read the documentation to see exactly where configuration files are read from

== Lab 04: Understanding Inventory
. create a `hosts` file with two two groups.  One named `ubuntu` and one named `amazon`,  Put `alpha` and `bravo` in the `ubuntu` group and `charlie` and `delta` in the `amazon` group
. apply the `ping` module again, using the `hosts` file this time
. apply the `ping` module, but only to the `ubuntu` group
. apply the `ping` module, but only to the `amazon` group
. create a `blue` group with `alpha` and `charlie` as members and a `green` group with `bravo` and `delta` as members
. apply the `ping` module, but only to the `blue` group
. apply the `ping` module, but only to the `green` group
. apply the `ping` module to the `all` group


TIP: Remember, Ubuntu boxes use `ubuntu` as the user name and Amazon Linux uses `ec2-user`
